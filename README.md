# spaCI: deciphering spatial cellular communications through adaptive graph model
Ziyang Tang, Tonglin Zhang, Baijian Yang, Jing Su, Qianqian Song

Cell-cell communications are vital for biological signaling and play important roles in complex diseases. Recent
advances in single-cell spatial transcriptomics (SCST) technologies allow examining the spatial cell
communication landscapes and hold the promise for disentangling the complex ligand-receptor interactions across
cells. However, due to frequent dropout events and noisy signals in SCST data, it is challenging and lack of
effective and tailored methods to accurately infer cellular communications. Herein, to decipher the cell-to-cell
communications from SCST profiles, we propose a novel adaptive graph model with attention mechanisms named
spaCI. spaCI incorporates both spatial locations and gene expression profiles of cells to identify the active ligandreceptor signaling axis across neighboring cells. Through benchmarking with currently available methods, spaCI
shows superior performance on both simulation data and real SCST datasets. Furthermore, spaCI is able to
identify the upstream transcriptional factors mediating the active ligand-receptor interactions. For biological
insights, we have applied spaCI to the seqFISH+ data of mouse cortex and the NanoString CosMx SMI data of
non-small cell lung cancer samples. spaCI reveals the hidden ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions from the sparse
seqFISH+ data, meanwhile identifies the inconspicuous L-R interactions including THBS1âˆ’ITGB1 between
fibroblast and tumors in NanoString CosMx SMI data. spaCI further reveals that SMAD3 plays an important role
in regulating the crosstalk between fibroblasts and tumors, which contributes to the prognosis of lung cancer
patients. Collectively, spaCI addresses the challenges in interrogating SCST data for gaining insights into the
underlying cellular communications, thus facilitates the discoveries of disease mechanisms, effective biomarkers,
and therapeutic targets.

## FAQ
* __How can I install spaCI?__       
You can download spaCI from our github link:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/QSong-github/spaCI.git
  ```
  spaCI is built based on pytorch, tested in Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA environment(cuda 11.2)
  the requirement packages includes:
  ```
  torchvision==0.11.1
  torch==1.6.0
  tqdm==4.47.0
  typing==3.7.4.3
  numpy==1.13.3
  pandas==1.5.1
  PyYAML==6.0
  ```
  or you can also use the following scripts:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* __I want to try the toy demo, Can I train it in one command line?__    
  You can use the following commands:
  ```
  python configuration.py --trainroot dataset/triplet.csv --testroot dataset/test_pairs.csv --predroot dataset/test_lr_pairs.csv --matrixroot dataset/exp_data_LR.csv --adjroot dataset/spatial_graph.csv --ymlname conf.yml --threshold 0.9' 
  python main_yaml.py
  ```
  or please refer to our tutorials [here](https://github.com/tonyyang1995/spaCI/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_train.ipynb)

* __Can I apply SpaCI in my own dataset? And how to generate the desired format for spaCI?__         
    We prepare a tutorial [here](https://github.com/tonyyang1995/spaCI/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_preprocessing_R.md)

* __Do I need a GPU for running spaCI?__    
    The toy dataset worked find on a standard laptop without a GPU. You can modified in the configuration.yml file, setting " use_cuda='cpu' ". However, GPU is recommand for computational efficiency, and it will speed up your experiments when the data grows larger and larger. 

* __Can I generate my own conf using command lines?__    
    some users want to try different hypterparameters, and may not want to manually modify the configure.yml. So we prepare a script to generate the yaml files for you, please refer to [here](https://github.com/QSong-github/spaCI/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_conf.ipynb) for details.
